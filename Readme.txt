****************************************************************************
CrunchTime is a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator for the
iOS platform (primarily designed for iPhone and iPod Touch)
developed by a group of four graduate students as an educational
project for graduate software engineering course at the computer
science department of The University of Texas at San Antonio
in Spring 2010.

Note that this source code is provided as is with no guarantees,
and developers take no responsibility for it, and no additional
support or documentation will be provided for this project.

The main purpose of publishing this code is to provide a good
case study for learning iPhone development.

The implementaiton is described in details on my blog:
